# iTerms

**iTerms** is an approach designed to translate natural language Terms of Service (ToS) into the Terms of Service Language ([**TOSL**](https://w3id.org/tosl/)) model using LLMs. The core idea is to guide the construction of a knowledge graph through a structured, multi-phase process that progressively transforms unstructured legal text into a formal representation.

## Repository Structure
`data/`
A collection of real use cases and their expected labels derived from an actual agreement.

`metamodel/`
Metamodel resources including a rule construction guide using TOSL and a simplified TOSL/ODRL ontology.

`iTerms.ipynb`
Orchestrates the multi-phase pipeline including metadata extraction, TTL modeling, and validation.
